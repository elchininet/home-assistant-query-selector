# Changelog

## [4.1.0] - 2024-01-13

- Make the event threshold a property that can be sent by the clients instead a constant. With this change the event threshold has been changed from `50` to `450`.

## [4.0.0] - 2024-01-04

- Breaking change: refactored the event names and created a new event (an event that will be triggered if any panel is loaded not only a lovelace panel)

## [3.0.0] - 2024-01-02

- Breaking change: Removed "lovelace" string from all the events because these events can be triggered on any dashboard if the `listen` method is called. The new even names are:
    * ON_PANEL_LOAD (`onPanelLoad`)
    * ON_MORE_INFO_DIALOG_OPEN (`onMoreInfoDialogOpen`)
    * ON_HISTORY_AND_LOGBOOK_DIALOG_OPEN (`onHistoryAndLogBookDialogOpen`)
    * ON_SETTINGS_DIALOG_OPEN (`onSettingsDialogOpen`)
- Fix a bug: if one of the elements in a tree is null, return null instead of trying to perform a query on a null element which will throw an error
