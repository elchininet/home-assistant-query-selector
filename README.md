## Introduction

When one wants to build a `Home Assistant` front-end plugin, like many of the ones published in [HACS], most of the time first thing to do is dealing with query-selection of `DOM` elements. This is a tedius task, because `Home Assistant` elements are custom [WebComponents], so when the `DOM` loads, most of those elements don‘t exist, they will be created in an asynchronous way and not all of them at the same time. On top of that, as they are `WebComponents`, many of them have their own `DOM` subtree under a [ShadowDOM], something that makes the task of query-selecting elements double tedious.

As I develop and maintain several `Home Assistant` plugins that change the style of the `DOM` elements, I find myself repeating the same piece of logic over and over to select the elements, and when the `Home Asistant` front-end code changes ([something that occurs more than I would like](https://github.com/NemesisRE/kiosk-mode/issues/27)), I need to go and fix the same in all of them.

This is from where the idea of `home-assistant-query-selector` comes from. Imagine instantiating a class, and without querying for any element, through promises, just wait for the main `Home Assistant` DOM elements to be created and rendered to be able to access them. That sounds great! doesn‘t it?. In that way, the `Home Assistant` plugins that I maintain could be agnostic to the `DOM` tree, and if someting changes with a new version and all the plugins break at the same time, the changes to fix them could be done in a single place, to fix the plugins only a simple update of this library is needed once the patch is released.

### How to detect if something will break with a new Home Assistant version?

There are exhaustive end-to-end tests in place in this library, when a new version of `Home Assistant` is released, running the end-to-end tests in this repository will ensure that the library still works with the new version, so no need to manually check this.

### Code example

More details of the API can be consulted in [the API section](#api):

```typescript
import { HAQuerySelector } from 'home-assistant-query-selector';

const instance = new HAQuerySelector();

// This even will be triggered when the listen method is called
// You can also use the enum value HAQuerySelectorEvent.ON_LISTEN
instance.addEventListener('onListen', ({ detail }) => {

    const { HOME_ASSISTANT, HOME_ASSISTANT_MAIN, HA_SIDEBAR } = detail;

    // Querying the ha-sidebar element from the home-assistant element
    HOME_ASSISTANT.selector.$.query('home-assistant-main').$.query('ha-sidebar').element
        .then((sidebar) => {
            // sidebar === ha-sidebar element
        });

    // Deep-querying the sidebar element
    HOME_ASSISTANT.selector.deepQuery('ha-sidebar').element
        .then((sidebar) => {
            // sidebar === ha-sidebar element
        });

    // When the sidebar is available in the DOM
    HA_SIDEBAR.element
        then((sidebar) => {
            // Do whatever we want with the sidebar
        });
});

// This event will be triggered when any panel loads
// You can also use the enum value HAQuerySelectorEvent.ON_PANEL_LOAD
instance.addEventListener('onPanelLoad', ({ detail }) => {

    const { PARTIAL_PANEL_RESOLVER } = detail;

    // When the partial panel resolver is available in the DOM
    PARTIAL_PANEL_RESOLVER.element
        .then((partialPanelResolver) => {
            // Do whatever we want with the partial panel resolver
        });

});

// This event will be triggered every time a lovelace dashboard loads
// You can also use the enum value HAQuerySelectorEvent.ON_LOVELACE_PANEL_LOAD
instance.addEventListener('onLovelacePanelLoad', ({ detail }) => {

    const { HEADER, HA_PANEL_LOVELACE } = detail;

    // When the header is available in the DOM
    HEADER.element
        .then((header) => {
            // Do whatever we want with the header
        });    

    // Querying all the ha-icon-button elements inside the .action-items in the header
    HEADER.selector.query('.action-items ha-icon-button').all
        .then((buttons) => {
            // buttons === Search, Assist, and Open dashboard menu elements (top-right header buttons)
        });

    // Querying the hui-root shadowRoot
    HA_PANEL_LOVELACE.selector.$.query('hui-root').$.element
        .then((shadowRoot) => {
            // shadowRoot === hui-root‘s shadowRoot
        });

});

// This event will be triggered every time a more-info dialog is open
// You can also use the enum value HAQuerySelectorEvent.ON_MORE_INFO_DIALOG_OPEN
instance.addEventListener('onMoreInfoDialogOpen', ({ detail }) => {

    // When the ha-more-info-info element is available in the DOM
    detail.HA_MORE_INFO_DIALOG_INFO.element.then((dialogInfo) => {
        // Do whatever we want with the dialogInfo element
    });

});

// Start to listen
instance.listen();
```

## Installation of the library

#### npm

```bash
npm install home-assistant-query-selector
```

#### yarn

```bash
yarn add home-assistant-query-selector
```

#### PNPM

```bash
pnpm add home-assistant-query-selector
```

## API

### Class instantiation

The `HAQuerySelector` class can be instantiated sending an optional parameter, this parameter will decide how much time is required to query for each element before giving up.

```typescript
new HAQuerySelector([config])
```

#### config optional parameter

```typescript
{
    retries?: number;
    delay?: number;
}
```

| Parameter    | Optional      | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| retries      | yes           | How many retries before giving up (defaults to 100) |
| delay        | yes           | Delay between each retry (defaults to 50)           |

### Public methods

`HAQuerySelector` instances count with a public method. When it is called, this method will trigger the `onListen` and `onPanelLoad` (and `onLovelacePanelLoad` if the panel in which it is invoked is a lovelace panel) events inmediatly and start to watch for changes in the `DOM` to trigger the proper events.

```typescript
instance.listen();
```

### Events

The `HAQuerySelector` class extends from [EventTarget], so it is possible to add events listeners to it. It will dispatch events that will allow us to access the proper elements in the `DOM`.

#### onListen

This event is triggered when [the listen method](#public-methods) is called. It is useful if you only want to access the main Home Assistant elements only once.

```typescript
instance.addEventListener('onListen', function({detail}) {
    /* detail:
    {
        HOME_ASSISTANT: {...},
        HOME_ASSISTANT_MAIN: {...},
        HA_DRAWER: {...},
        ...
    }
    */
});
```

The dispatched event is a [CustomEvent] and its `detail` property is an object containing the main `Home Assistant` `DOM` elements. All the properties and methods included in each element are Promises, so they are async and will be resolved when the element is ready to work with it.

##### onListen event elements

This is the list of the elements available inside the `detail` property of the `onListen` event:

![dom tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elchininet/home-assistant-query-selector/master/images/dom-tree.png)

| Detail element           | DOM element              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |

| `element`                 | Promise that resolves in the respective `DOM` element           |
| `selector`                | Object that allows one to query for elements using dot notation |

#### onPanelLoad

This event is triggered when [the listen method](#public-methods) is called or when any panel is loaded.

```typescript
instance.addEventListener('onPanelLoad', function({detail}) {
    /* detail:
    {
        HOME_ASSISTANT: {...},
        HOME_ASSISTANT_MAIN: {...},
        HA_DRAWER: {...},
